# **APP_NAME**

Compute app scaffolded by `sf compute generate --language node`, built on the
Heroku AppLink Node.js starter (Fastify).

## Endpoints

- `GET /api-docs` -- interactive Swagger UI generated from `api-spec.yaml`.
- `GET /healthcheck` -- used by the AppLink Service Mesh to check app health.

Add your own routes in `src/routes/index.js` (see the commented example
there), and a matching operation in `api-spec.yaml` for each one that should
be published as an External Service.

## Local development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploy

```
sf compute deploy --target-org <org>
```
