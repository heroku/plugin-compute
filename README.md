`sf compute` -- the CLI for Salesforce Compute: generate, deploy, and operate
org-resident custom app logic (built on Heroku) invocable from Apex/Flow via
AppLink External Services.

## Learn about `sf` plugins

Salesforce CLI plugins are based on the [oclif plugin framework](https://oclif.io/docs/introduction). Read the [plugin developer guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_plugins.meta/sfdx_cli_plugins/cli_plugins_architecture_sf_cli.htm) to learn about Salesforce CLI plugin development.

This repository contains a lot of additional scripts and tools to help with general Salesforce node development and enforce coding standards. You should familiarize yourself with some of the [node developer packages](#tooling) used by Salesforce. There is also a default circleci config using the [release management orb](https://github.com/forcedotcom/npm-release-management-orb) standards.

Additionally, there are some additional tests that the Salesforce CLI will enforce if this plugin is ever bundled with the CLI. These test are included by default under the `posttest` script and it is required to keep these tests active in your plugin if you plan to have it bundled.

### Tooling

- [@salesforce/core](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-core)
- [@salesforce/kit](https://github.com/forcedotcom/kit)
- [@salesforce/sf-plugins-core](https://github.com/salesforcecli/sf-plugins-core)
- [@salesforce/ts-types](https://github.com/forcedotcom/ts-types)
- [@salesforce/ts-sinon](https://github.com/forcedotcom/ts-sinon)

This plugin is bundled with the [Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli). For more information on the CLI, read the [getting started guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_intro.htm).

We always recommend using the latest version of these commands bundled with the CLI, however, you can install a specific version or tag if needed.

## Install

```bash
sf plugins install @heroku/plugin-compute@x.y.z
```

### Build

To build the plugin locally, run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:salesforcecli/plugin-compute

# Install the dependencies and compile
npm ci && npm run build
```

To use your plugin, run using the local `./bin/dev` or `./bin/dev.cmd` file.

```bash
# Run using local run file.
./bin/dev compute generate --name MyComputeApp
```

There should be no differences when running via the Salesforce CLI or using the local run file. However, it can be useful to link the plugin to do some additional testing or run your commands from anywhere on your machine.

```bash
# Link your plugin to the sf cli
sf plugins link .
# To verify
sf plugins
```
